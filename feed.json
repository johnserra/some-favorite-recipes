I like the original recipe prepared with guanciale (or pancetta), but I live in Istanbul, Turkey where they are hard to come by. So, I have modified the recipe to use Turkish Kavurma which is braised beef and lamb with lamb tail fat packed in a casing (non edible) like sausage.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<p> </p>",

I first tasted this dish back in the days when I was in Crotone while working on a yacht. It is such a simple dish, yet very elegant, and tastes wonderfully like the sea.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>500gr. Spaghetti</li>\n<li>500gr. Vongole</li>\n<li>Olive Oil</li>\n<li>2-3 Cloves of Garlic</li>\n<li>Rock Salt</li>\n<li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>\n<li>1 Glass Dry White Wine</li>\n<li>A Bunch of Parsley</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Boil plenty of water in a large pot.</li>\n<li>Heat a generous ammount of olive oil in a pan.</li>\n<li>Add the whole cloves of garlic in the heated olive oil.</li>\n<li>Remove the cloves once they are nicely browned. Put them aside...</li>\n<li>Add the vongole to the pan and stir them gently for about 15-20 seconds.</li>\n<li>Add the glass of white wine and let it simmer.</li>\n<li>Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water. Don't over do it. The fresh vongole will be salty from the sea.</li>\n<li>Let vongole simmer until they begin to open. If they don't, they are not good to eat. Send to /dev/null :(</li>\n<li>Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Follow instructions on the package for time. I generally go for 6 or 7 minutes.</li>\n<li>I strain the pasta usually a little early. I keep some of the water and then usually don't use it.</li>\n<li>Dump the pasta over the vongole and mix it in gently. It will finish to cook... and soak up the delicious broth.</li>\n<li>One the spaghetti are nice and shiny and have absorbed the sauce, sprinkle roughly chopped parsley over it and mix in.</li>\n<li>Buon Apetito!</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>",
