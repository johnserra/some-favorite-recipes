    <em>Spaghetti Alla Carbonara with Braised Meat</em>
    <p>Spaghetti Alla Carbonara is another of my favorite dishes. I love the taste of guanciale, or even pancetta for
        that matter, but I have been living in Istanbul for several years and have become accustomed to preparing this
        dish with Turkish Kavurma, which is a mix of braised beef and lamb meat with lamb tail fat that is compressed
        into a log shape to preserve it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500gr. Spaghetti</li>
        <li>500gr. Vongole</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2-3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Rock Salt</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1 Glass Dry White Wine</li>
        <li>A Bunch of Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil plenty of water in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Heat a generous ammount of olive oil in a pan.</li>
        <li>Add the whole cloves of garlic in the heated olive oil.</li>
        <li>Remove the cloves once they are nicely browned. Put them aside...</li>
        <li>Add the vongole to the pan and stir them gently for about 15-20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the glass of white wine and let it simmer.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water. Don't over do it. The fresh vongole will be salty from the sea.
        </li>
        <li>Let vongole simmer until they begin to open. If they don't, they are not good to eat. Send to /dev/null :(
        </li>
        <li>Add the spaghetti to the boiling water. Follow instructions on the package for time. I generally go for 6 or
            7 minutes.</li>
        <li>I strain the pasta usually a little early. I keep some of the water and then usually don't use it.</li>
        <li>Dump the pasta over the vongole and mix it in gently. It will finish to cook... and soak up the delicious
            broth.</li>
        <li>One the spaghetti are nice and shiny and have absorbed the sauce, sprinkle roughly chopped parsley over it
            and mix in.</li>
        <li>Buon Apetito!</li>
    </ol>
